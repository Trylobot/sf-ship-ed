  handy bar graph so you can see where your ship falls in the grand scheme
- corresponding CSV row attempted to be auto-loaded when loading a *.ship

- users of editor in a Mac OS running Wine can now provide the starfarer
  install dir with success
- variant hullID updated automatically
- ship image loaded automatically when ship data is loaded
- if an image is manually loaded, the editor will search upwards for a
  "graphics" directory; if it is found, the path to the image will be inserted
  into the ship data; otherwise it will remain unmodified
- default save-file-names for *.ship and *.variant
______________________________________________________________________________
editor version 1.9 (starfarer 0.51a)
- string editing is made faster for values that are enums; instead of typing
  them, use arrow left/right to choose a value from the list of acceptable
  values. the field is updated immediately.
- can now open, edit and save *.variants - use [1] and [2] to toggle between
  *.ship mode and *.variant mode; still use [D] and [V] to open/save 
- click a weapon slot to assign a weapon from the list of weapons that are
  valid to occupy that slot; filters based on size & type of slot from
  currently loaded *.ship data
- press M to load a mod; it will be noted in the settings data so that it is
  auto-loaded on next startup of the editor; this will add the mod's data
  to the stock data for weapon slot selection and OP cost analysis & validation
- While in variant mode:
  Press T to edit variant string-data
  Press G to edit weapon groups
  Press F & C to increment flux mods. Shift+F & Shift+C to decrement. They
    will cap out at the limit for your ship's hull size
  Press H to select hull mods
    If you exceed the OP max specified in the ship CSV for the ship's hullID,
    it will be red-coloured but it will not otherwise prevent you
- WARNING: it is now REQUIRED that Starfarer be installed on the computer
  where the editor is being used, as the vanilla data is automatically loaded
  to speed up selection of multi-select values, and to prevent the editor
  from needing to be explicitly updated when Starfarer adds new such values
- fixed bug with key states after opening system dialogs in windows
