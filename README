Prerequisites for Compilation
=============================
* BlitzMax http://blitzmax.com/

Open sf-ship-ed.bmx using the MaxIDE program that ships with the BlitzMax installation package. Build & Run.

Alternatively, use the command line compiler (BMK) directly:
bmk makeapp -a -r -t gui -o sf-ship-ed.exe sf-ship-ed.bmx



Prerequisites for Use
=====================
* Starfarer http://fractalsoftworks.com/

This is an editor for modders of the game Starfarer, and it requires
that you have installed a copy of the game. The editor scans the core
game data and uses it to populate graphs and string enumerations to help
you decide on reasonable starting values, so that educated guesses are
more convenient. It is not meant to be a full-on balancing tool, however.
