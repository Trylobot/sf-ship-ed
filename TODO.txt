When opening a ship file:
	refresh TModal* data; bounds, weapons, engines coordinates etc are cached and have to be refreshed!
	auto-attempt load of ship variant and ship CSV data

When opening an image:
	clear all data, but use names derived from the image name

fighter wing csv data in mode 4
- the fighter image should always be sourced from the variant referenced
  by the currently active CSV Wing data. check the variant for the hull id,
  check the hull for the image, try and load it, etc.
  if not found, use 'error.png'

BUG: Editing weapon groups with no assigned weapons
  G, right arrow
  causes crash

- To create "maneuvering jets"
  set the otherwise-unused "contrailSize" field to 128 to flag the engines as hidden
  They'll be activated by any system that modifies the engine glow.


enhance rjson.parse() and rjson.stringify()
- allow specifying a transform-set-id (or an array of them) as an argument
- this determines what transforms to use for the operation
- require defining a transform-set-id when adding a transform
- allow clearing of all transforms, or specifically those in a set
- allow setting of number precision by specifying a transform
- allow setting of override type by specifying a transform (parse only)

load all shipsystems
- propagate system ID's to enum "system.id" and use in CSV mode
- show system name and description in CSV mode instead of bar graph
- (?) show CSV "defense ID" in this context as well

support weapons in mode 5

support weapon csv data in mode 6

projectiles in mode 7

when changing weapon slot ID's in ship mode
- propagate changes to built-in weapon assignments
  and to the loaded variant as well

fix shitty performance in complex non-TSubroutine modal functions
- use static memory allocation and stateful transitions

zoom-to-cursor (UGH)

- key to Set CSV line to blank

- Allow to Type in values for the angle & firing arcs on weapons?

CSV - preserve blank lines and row-order

ship-mounted engine graphic previews

ship-mounted weapon graphic previews

phase effect preview

add zoom-out effect to CSV row id list (it's too long), (dirty hacks ftw)

Variant: Improve workflow for multiple weapon groups / linked / alternating / autofire.

Load new graphic (I): request permission from user to clear out (new) all data. ship hull, variant, csv.
