When opening a ship file:
	auto-attempt load of ship variant and ship CSV data

BUG: Editing weapon groups with no assigned weapons
  G, right arrow
  causes crash

- To create "maneuvering jets"
  set the otherwise-unused "contrailSize" field to 128 to flag the engines as hidden
  They'll be activated by any system that modifies the engine glow.

fighter wing csv data in mode 4

enhance rjson.parse() and rjson.stringify()
- allow specifying a transform-set-id (or an array of them) as an argument
- this determines what transforms to use for the operation
- require defining a transform-set-id when adding a transform
- allow clearing of all transforms, or specifically those in a set
- allow setting of number precision by specifying a transform
- allow setting of override type by specifying a transform (parse only)

load all shipsystems
- propagate system ID's to enum "system.id" and use in CSV mode
- show system name and description in CSV mode instead of bar graph
- (?) show CSV "defense ID" in this context as well

support weapons in mode 5

support weapon csv data in mode 6

projectiles in mode 7

when changing weapon slot ID's in ship mode
- propagate changes to built-in weapon assignments
  and to the loaded variant as well

fix shitty performance in complex non-TSubroutine modal functions
- use static memory allocation and stateful transitions

zoom-to-cursor (UGH)

- key to Set CSV line to blank

- Allow to Type in values for the angle & firing arcs on weapons?

CSV - preserve blank lines and row-order

phase effect preview

add zoom-out effect to CSV row id list (it's too long), (dirty hacks ftw)
